h2. Creating a template
Each page in BrowserCMS uses a single template, which is designed to provide overall layout structure of the page. Here's the general process
that a design team might follow to create a CMS template.

1. Start with a PSD or JPG of the design, which represents the end result of what the webpage should look like.
2. Create a static html file which implements that design.
3. When creating menus, use the same structural HTML markup as will be generated by the Menu API. (See Menu's below)
4. Change the file extension from .htm to .html.erb and add it as a template to the CMS.

h2. Menus
BrowserCMS provides an API to allow menus to be dynamically generated based on the sitemap. The purpose of this is to make
it easy to add new pages, without having to modify templates.
